## 🔧 Configuration

### Smart Contract
To use with a different contract:
1. Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `code1.js`
2. Replace `CONTRACT_ABI` with your contract's ABI
3. Ensure contract has the same function signatures

### Network Configuration
To change the target network:
1. Modify the network check in `checkNetwork()` function
2. Update MetaMask to connect to the desired network

## 🚨 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Security Considerations
- **Private Keys**: Never share your MetaMask seed phrase
- **Contract Verification**: Verify the smart contract on Etherscan
- **Gas Fees**: All transactions require ETH for gas fees
- **Network**: Ensure you're on the correct blockchain network

### 💡 Best Practices
- **Test First**: Use testnet for initial testing
- **Small Amounts**: Start with small pledge amounts
- **Verify Campaigns**: Check campaign details before pledging
- **Monitor Transactions**: Keep track of your transaction history

- Ensure MetaMask is connected to the correct network

**⏳ Long Transaction Times**
